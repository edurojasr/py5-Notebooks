# py5

py5 is a new version of Processing for Python 3.8+. It makes the Java Processing jars
available to the CPython interpreter using JPype. It can do just about all of the 2D and
3D drawing Processing can do, except with Python instead of Java code.

The goal of py5 is to create a new version of Processing that is integrated into the
Python ecosystem. Built into the library are thoughtful choices about how to best get
py5 to work with other popular Python libraries and tools such as Jupyter, numpy, and
Pillow.
