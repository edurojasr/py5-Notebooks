## py5

py5 is a new version of Processing for Python 3.8+. It makes the Java Processing jars
available to the CPython interpreter using JPype. It can do just about all of the 2D and
3D drawing Processing can do, except with Python instead of Java code.

The goal of py5 is to create a new version of Processing that is integrated into the
Python ecosystem. Built into the library are thoughtful choices about how to best get
py5 to work with other popular Python libraries and tools such as Jupyter, numpy, and
Pillow.

## Goals

Learn by doing and teaching python programming using a visual and artistically approach from processing.

## Notebooks categories

* [Learn Python and py5](./categories/learning_python_py5/) This is meat for teaching about python programming fundamentals using py5 as a frame work for teaching visually.
* [Tutorial](./categories/tutorials/) This are more focusing in py5 drawing and how to make stuff with it, this is the place for how to's.
* [Challenges](./categories/challenges/) Inspired by [The Coding Train](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Coding-Challenges) Challenges where you may find challenges using py5.
