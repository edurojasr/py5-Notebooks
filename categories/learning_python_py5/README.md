# Learning Python with py5

This [Category](categories) it's about learning Python visually using py5 as a framework
inspired by [Processing](https://processing.org/) using the flexible sketchbook approach
and python as programming language for learning how to code.

For me it's a welcome challenge to make something that may help other people to learn
how to code and how programming anything, since I first came across with the wonderful
[Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman) way to teach using p5 and Processing I
really got into learn how to code and all about programming without any Computer
Science background.

Now I have a Machine Learning and Deep Learning Certificate from the Texas Tech and
want to help other people without any CS background that want to learn how to code and
programming to see value in trying to learn and *what better way?* than using Python and
Processing.

## In this repository

I'm going to cover all the Python fundamentals and trying to go from the beginning of
*"Hello world"* to wherever the learning/teaching road takes us and the endless
possibilities that py5 enable ,e to keep learning in a visually way.

## Who is this repo for?

Anybody that what to learn Python using a visual approach in the style of Processing
using [py5](http://py5coding.org/) as framework and also learning py5.

## Chapters

[Hello py5 world!](/categories/learning_python_py5/1_hello_py5_world/)

## Tools

I'm going to make heavily use of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), since I'm a
Data Scientist I find great value on notebooks and py5 works great with it! if you not
know how to set up, I advice you to learn from [Get
Started](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/start/index.html) with jupyter notebooks or
you can watch [Rob Mulla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1sAzPojKMg) video about
setting up jupyter notebooks *I'm big fan of Rob*.

You may use:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1sAzPojKMg)
* [Jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/start/index.html)

## Installing py5

For the up to date instructions for *how to* install py5 and set it up for use inside
jupyter notebooks fallow the instruction in [
    py5 Install Docs
](https://py5coding.org/content/install.html)

Thank's to all this people, tools, and resources for teach me the basics of programming
and Python and Processing
